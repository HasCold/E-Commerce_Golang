To set up **Air** for live reloading your Go project on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Install Air**:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Ensure your Go environment is set up correctly.
   - Run the following command to install Air:
     ```bash
     go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
     ```
   - After installation, ensure that the Go `bin` directory is in your system's `PATH` to access the `air` command globally.

2. **Initialize Air in Your Project**:
   - Navigate to your Go project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```
   - Generate the Air configuration file by running:
     ```bash
     air init
     ```
   - This command creates an `.air.toml` file in your project root, which you can customize as needed.

3. **Configure Air (Optional)**:
   - Open the `.air.toml` file in a text editor.
   - Modify settings such as the build command, binary output location, and file watch patterns to suit your project's structure.
   - For example, to specify the main package and output binary:
     ```toml
     [build]
     cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main.exe ./cmd/api/."
     bin = "tmp/main.exe"
     ```
   - Ensure that the `cmd` path points to your main Go application file.

4. **Run Air**:
   - In your project directory, start Air by executing:
     ```bash
     air
     ```
   - Air will monitor your project files for changes and automatically rebuild and restart your application upon modifications.

**Note**: If you encounter issues with the `air` command not being recognized, ensure that your Go `bin` directory is included in your system's `PATH`.
